Register an account
===================

In order to register to the AI4EOSC platform you need to get an account on our `Login
system <https://login.cloud.ai4eosc.eu/realms/ai4eosc/account>`_. You can do this by
clicking on the "Register" link on the login page.

Please provide all the details that are listed in the registration form and preferably
use your **institutional account** (university, research center). This will speed up the
approval process.

After you have filled in all the details, click on the "Register" button. You will
receive an email with a link to confirm your registration. Click on the link to confirm
your registration and then you will be approved by an administrator.

Please remember that the approval process can take some time, so please be patient.
Also, be aware that just registering does not grant you access to the AI4EOSC platform,
you can learn more about this on the :doc:`/reference/user-access-levels` page.

Login to the platform
=====================

Once registered and approved, you can dirctly head to the :doc:`/reference/dashboard`
page and login to the platform.
