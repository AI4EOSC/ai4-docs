Authentication
==============

We offer two levels of authentication, depending on the services you want to access.

Basic authentication
--------------------

This authentication level will let use some basic features like:

* :ref:`Try a model in the Dashboard <user/index:Try a model>`
* :doc:`Deploy a model in your own cloud </user/howto/deploy/cloud>`

To create an account, go to the `EGI Check-In (prod) <https://aai.egi.eu/>`__
and login preferably with your **institutional account** (university, research center).
If this is not possible, please, use one of **Github** or **ORCID** but with the email
domain which identifies your organisation.
This will automatically create your new account at EGI Check-In.


Full authentication
-------------------

This authentication level will let use all the features the AI4OS stack has to offer, including:

* :ref:`Developing a model in the Dashboard <user/index:Develop a model>`
* :ref:`Training a model in the Dashboard <user/index:Train a model>`
* :ref:`Deploying a model in production <user/index:Deploy a model in production>`
* :doc:`Accessing the AI4OS storage </user/overview/storage>`

To access this authentication level, you need to be a `member` of either one of the following
projects:

* `AI4EOSC <https://ai4eosc.eu/>`__: AI for the European Open Science Cloud
* `iMagine <https://imagine-ai.eu/>`__: Imaging data and services for aquatic science
* `AI4Life <https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/>`__: AI models and methods for the life sciences

.. admonition:: External users
   :class: info

   If you are not a member of the above projects, consider joining either one of them
   by applying to the *Open calls for external usecases*.
   More information about the Calls can be found in their respective project's homepages.

   If you were not able to apply in time to an Open Call, you can always try to `reach us <https://ai4eosc.eu/contact/>`__
   explaining why and how you would like to use the platform.

To achieve full authentication, first create an account following the :ref:`Basic authentication <user/overview/auth:Basic authentication>` steps.
Then you have to enroll in one of the Virtual Organizations (VO) supported by the project.
Please :ref:`ask support <user/index:Support>` for the request link of your Virtual Organization.

When enrolling, you have to provide the following information in ``Comments``:

* Reason to use the platform (e.g. use case)
* Your institution or organization
* How did you learn about the platform

You will need to wait until you are **approved** before being able to start using the
services.
