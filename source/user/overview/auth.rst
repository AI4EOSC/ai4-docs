Authentication
==============

The authentication for the AI4OS stack depends on the platform it is deployed.

Current supported platforms use the following Identity providers:

* **AI4EOSC**: :ref:`EGI Check-In (prod)  <user/overview/auth:EGI Check-In (prod)>`
* **iMagine**: :ref:`EGI Check-In (prod)  <user/overview/auth:EGI Check-In (prod)>`


How to create an account
------------------------

EGI Check-In (prod)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the `EGI Check-In (prod) <https://aai.egi.eu/>`__ and login preferably with your
**institutional account** (university, research center).
If this is not possible, please, use one of **Github** or **ORCID** but with the email
domain which identifies your organisation.
This will automatically create your new account at EGI Check-In.

Now you have to enroll in one of the Virtual Organizations (VO) supported by the project.
Please ask the support email to get the request link of your Virtual Organization.

You will need to wait until you are **approved** before being able to start using the
services (eg. the :doc:`AI4OS Dashboard <dashboard>`).

.. warning::
    You have to provide (e.g. in ``Comments``) the following information:

    * Reason to use the platform (e.g. use case)
    * Your institution or organization
    * How did you learn about the platform
