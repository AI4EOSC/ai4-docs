Authentication
==============

The authentication for the AI4OS stack depends on the platform it is deployed.

Current supported platforms use the following Identity providers:

* **AI4EOSC**: :ref:`EGI Check-In (demo)  <user/overview/auth:EGI Check-In (demo)>`
* **iMagine**: :ref:`EGI Check-In (demo)  <user/overview/auth:EGI Check-In (demo)>`

.. * **AI4EOSC**: :ref:`EGI Check-In (demo)  <user/overview/auth:EGI Check-In (prod)>`
.. * **iMagine**: :ref:`EGI Check-In (demo)  <user/overview/auth:EGI Check-In (prod)>`

Some services (eg. Nextcloud) still rely on the :ref:`DEEP IAM  <user/overview/auth:DEEP IAM>` provider.


How to create an account
------------------------

EGI Check-In (demo)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to the `EGI Check-In (demo) <https://aai-demo.egi.eu/>`__ and login ith your
preferred account (university, Github, ORCID, Google, etc).
This will automatically create your new account.

Now you have to enroll in one of the Virtual Organizations (VO) supported by the project:

* `AI4EOSC <https://aai-demo.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:179>`__ (``vo.ai4eosc.eu``)
* `iMagine <https://aai-demo.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:181>`__ (``vo.imagine-ai.eu``)
* `Tutorials <https://aai-demo.egi.eu/registry/co_petitions/start/coef:10>`__ (``training.egi.eu``): reserved for people who will experiment with the platform during a tutorial

You will need to wait until you are **approved** before being able to start using the services (eg. the :doc:`AI4OS Dashboard <dashboard>`).
