Quickstart Guide
=================

First of all, welcome onboard! ðŸŽ‰

Now, here are some guiding steps for your first contact with the AI4OS platform:

1. Have a look at the :doc:`platform architecture </user/overview/architecture>`.
   It will enable you to get an idea of how all the different components fit together.
2. :doc:`Create an account </user/overview/auth>` in the Platform so that you are
   able to access the services.
3. Take a look at the different :doc:`user roles </user/overview/user-roles>`.
   This will give you a better idea on how the platform could be useful to you.
4. Once you have decided what is your user role, take a look at the corresponding
   HowTo tutorials.

   If you still don't know where to start, deploying a module in the Dashboard to
   :doc:`perform a simple inference </user/howto/try/dashboard-gradio>` is always a good
   choice to get a grasp of the Platform functionalities.

Enjoy! ðŸš€
