In this section, we will offer some insight on to where the AI4OS stack is heading.

First, the are a number of mature features that are in the process of being integrated
in the stack:

* 📌 new unified AI module structure
* 📈 usage stats (per user and per VO) are displayed in the Dashboard
* 📈 support for secrets in the Dashboard (eg. Federated Learning server)
* 📈 inference endpoints with OSCAR
* 📈 short-lived endpoints to try the modules
* 📈 email notifications for deployments that take a longer to deploy
* 📈 new tool for image annotation (CVAT)

* 📈 carbon footprint estimator for your deployments
* 📈 show map with datacenter usage stats
* 📈 graph visualizations of your module/deployment metadata
* 📈 ability to pause deployments
* 📌 using volumes in deployments to better share data across deployments
