🚀 Upcoming features
--------------------

In this section, we will offer some insight on to where the AI4OS stack is heading.

First, the are a number of mature features that are in the process of being integrated
in the stack:

* 📌 new unified AI module structure
* 📈 inference endpoints with OSCAR
* 📈 inference endpoints with Nomad
* 📈 try model endpoints with OSCAR
* 📈 try model endpoints with Nomad
* 📈 email notifications for training deployments that take a longer to deploy
* 📈 new tool for image annotation (CVAT)
* 📈 new tool for efficient video streaming (Kafka)

Along with these upcoming features, we are exploring more improvements. These are
in an experimental status and might not finally get integrated in the stack.

* 📈 carbon footprint estimator for your deployments
* 📈 graph visualizations of your module/deployment metadata
* 📈 ability to pause deployments
* 📌 using volumes in deployments to better share data across deployments
