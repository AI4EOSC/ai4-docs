How to use Nextcloud with rclone
================================

**rclone** is a tool that enables you to synchronize contents between your machine and a remote storage.
It is kind of an `rsync <https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync>`__ but for remote storages.
Although we will demonstrate here how to use it with Nextcloud, it can be used with many
different remote storages (Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3, etc)


Installing rclone
-----------------

All applications in the :doc:`AI4OS Dashboard</user/overview/dashboard>` are packed in a Docker image and have
`rclone <https://rclone.org/>`__ installed by default. If you want to create a Docker containing your own application, you should install rclone
in the container to be able to access the data stored remotely.
When developing an application with the :doc:`AI4OS Modules Template </user/overview/cookiecutter-template>`,
the Dockerfile already includes installation of rclone.

To install rclone on a Docker container based on Ubuntu you should add the following code:

.. code-block:: docker

    # Install rclone (needed if syncing with NextCloud for training; otherwise remove)
    RUN curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb && \
        dpkg -i rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb && \
        apt install -f && \
        mkdir /srv/.rclone/ && \
        touch /srv/.rclone/rclone.conf && \
        rm rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb && \
        rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

To install it directly on your machine:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb
    $ dpkg -i rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb
    $ apt install -f
    $ rm rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb

For other Linux flavors, please refer to the `rclone official site <https://rclone.org/downloads/>`__.


Configuring rclone
------------------

First, you need to get your RCLONE credentials.

After login into the `AI4OS Nextcloud <https://share.services.ai4os.eu/>`__ with the :doc:`appropriate authentication </user/overview/auth>`,  go to
(1) **Settings** (top right corner) âžœ (2) **Security** âžœ (3) **Devices & sessions**. Set a name for your
application (typically in the docs we will use ``rshare``) and click on **Create new app password**.
This will generate your ``<user>`` and ``<password>`` credentials. Your username should start with ``EGI_Checkin-...``.

.. image:: /_static/images/nc-access.png

Now you have several options to configure rclone:

Configuring via ``env`` variables (Dashboard users)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your are creating a deployment from the **Dashboard**, then you only need to fill the
``rclone_user`` and ``rclone_password`` parameters in the configuration form (**Storage options**) and we will
automatically set up rclone configuration for you via setting environment variables.

Once you machine is launched, you must run the following command in the terminal to properly configure rclone:

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo export RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_PASS=$(rclone obscure $RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_PASS) >> /root/.bashrc
    $ source /root/.bashrc

.. We do this to spare users from having to install rclone in their local machines just to obscure the password.

This is because, to connect with the remote, rclone needs to use an obscured version of the password, not the raw one.

If your rclone version is higher than ``1.62.2``, then you must need to adapt the
endpoint, running this command
(see :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions <user/others/faq:ðŸ”¥ rclone fails to connect>` for more info):

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo export RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_URL=${RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_URL//webdav}/dav/files/${RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_USER} >> /root/.bashrc

.. TODO: change this commmand if the default endpoint in the API changes

You can always check those env variables afterwards:

.. code-block:: console

    $ printenv | grep RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_
    RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_VENDOR=nextcloud
    RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_PASS=***some-password***
    RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_URL=https://share.services.ai4os.eu/remote.php/webdav/
    RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_TYPE=webdav
    RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_USER=***some-user***

and modify them if needed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_PASS=***new-password***  # remember this should an obscured version of the raw password --> `rclone obscure <raw-password>`


Configuring via ``rclone config`` (local development)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are developing in a Docker container deployed in your **local machine**,
one can use instead the ``rclone config`` command that will create a configuration file (``rclone.conf``) for rclone.

First, make sure you don't have a remote with the same name already configured, as names will collide.

.. code-block:: console

    $ rclone listremotes

This should return an empty output. If this is not the case, make sure you don't have a remote configured via environment variables (previous section), which is the case if you are running this in a Dashboard deployment. To clear that remote, you just need to unset the variables:

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo 'unset RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_VENDOR RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_PASS RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_URL RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_TYPE RCLONE_CONFIG_RSHARE_USER' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc

Then run ``rclone config`` and answer the questions to configure the new remote:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rclone config
    choose "n"  for "New remote"
    choose name for AI4OS Nextcloud --> rshare
    choose "Type of Storage" --> Webdav
    provide AI4OS Nextcloud URL for webdav access --> https://share.services.ai4os.eu/remote.php/webdav/
    choose Vendor --> Nextcloud
    specify "user" --> (see `<user>` in "Configuring rclone" above).
    password --> y (Yes type in my own password)
    specify "password" --> (see `<password>` in "Configuring rclone" above).
    bearer token --> ""
    Edit advanced config? --> n (No)
    Remote config --> y (Yes this is OK)
    Current remotes --> q (Quit config)

This will create an configuration file like the following:

.. code-block:: console

    [rshare]
    type = webdav
    url = https://share.services.ai4os.eu/remote.php/webdav/
    vendor = nextcloud
    user = ***some-username***
    pass = ***some-userpassword**  --> this is equivalent to `rclone obscure <password>`

By default:

* if you are on your local machine or inside a local Docker container, ``rclone.conf`` is created in ``$HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf``.
* if you are inside a Dashboard deployment, ``rclone.conf`` is created in ``/srv/.rclone/rclone.conf``.

For security reasons, the ``rclone.conf`` should never be saved as part of the Docker image. If you are running rclone from inside a Docker container, you should mount ``rclone.conf`` at runtime directly as a volume.

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker run -ti -v $HOSTDIR_WITH_RCLONE_CONF/rclone.conf:/$HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf <your-docker-image>

One can also mount the ``rclone.conf`` file at a custom location and tell rclone where to find it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker run -ti -v $HOSTDIR_WITH_RCLONE_CONF/rclone.conf:/custom/path/to/rclone.conf <your-docker-image>
    $ rclone --config /custom/path/to/rclone.conf


Using rclone
------------

You can check that everything works fine with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rclone listremotes    # check you don't have two remote storages with same name
    $ rclone about rshare:  # should output your used space in Nextcloud.

.. tip::

    If ``listremotes`` is listing two remotes with the same name you probably configured the rclone twice.
    Most likely you ran ``rclone config`` on a machine deployed with the Dashboard, so you
    have both the ``env`` and ``rclone.conf`` configurations. To fix this, either remove the ``env`` variables
    (echo ``unset`` command into the ``.bashrc``) or delete the ``rclone.conf`` file.

You can start copying files from your remote to your local:

.. code-block:: console

    $ rclone copy rshare:/some/remote/path /some/local/path

.. tip::

    Uploading to Nextcloud can be particularly slow if your dataset is composed of lots of small files.
    Considering zipping your folder before uploading.

    .. code-block:: console

        $ zip -r <foldername>.zip <foldername>
        $ unzip <foldername>.zip
