How to organize a tutorial
==========================

* Your users should :doc:`enroll </user/overview/auth>` in ``training.egi.eu`` VO.
* Then send an email to ``giuseppe.larocca@egi.eu`` with the complete list of
  participants so that he can approve them.
* Once your users are approved they will be able to access the
  :doc:`Tutorials Dashboard </user/overview/dashboard>`.
  Bear in mind that the Tutorial Dashboard won't let them
  use GPUs (scarce ressource!) and will have other small limitations in terms of RAM,
  CPUs and disk.
